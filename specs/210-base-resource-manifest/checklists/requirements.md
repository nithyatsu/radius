# Specification Quality Checklist: Base Resource Manifest

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-06-19
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- One [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker remains (OQ-001): explicit-inheritance vs. implicit-injection approach. This is the central UX decision the user explicitly asked the spec to expose for resolution — it is **intentionally retained** and must be resolved via `/speckit.clarify` or by direct answer before `/speckit.plan`.
- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
